# Cardiac MRI Classification â€” Kaggle (1st place)

Classification of heart diseases from cardiac MRIs using anatomical feature engineering and stacked machine-learning models.

## Methods
- Feature engineering from segmented MRIs (volume, ejection fraction, ratiosâ€¦)
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna

## Results
- ðŸ¥‡ **1st place** on the Kaggle private leaderboard

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/medelbechir/Cardiac-MRI-Classification.git
cd Cardiac-MRI-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
