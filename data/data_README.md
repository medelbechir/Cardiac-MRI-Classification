# Data

The full dataset (~700 MB) is **not included** in this repository because it exceeds GitHub's recommended size limits.

## Dataset structure
When downloaded and unzipped, the dataset folder should look like:
```
data/
├── Train/
├── Test/
├── metaDataTrain.csv
├── metaDataTest.csv
└── SampleSubmission.csv
```

## How to get the data
Please download the dataset from its official source (Kaggle)
and place **all files and folders exactly** as shown above inside the `data/` directory of this repository:
```
Cardiac-MRI-Classification/
└── data/
    ├── Train/
    ├── Test/
    ├── metaDataTrain.csv
    ├── metaDataTest.csv
    └── SampleSubmission.csv
```

The notebooks will then run as expected.
